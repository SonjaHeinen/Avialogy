            Avialogy (Europe) builds on the premise that there is a relationship between primary systems
      	    of aerial commotion and phenomena in the human world. This study interprets movements
      	    and relative positions of powered, fixed-wing machines in cruising altitude.
            Simply put: It's your horoscope based on aircraft, not star constellations.
          </p>
          <p>
          	Avialogy helps navigate through life since 1903.
